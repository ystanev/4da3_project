## Introduction
In this course, we have looked at four different approaches to classifying data:  

* Fishers Linear Discriminant
* Linear Perceptron
* Adaline
* Linear Support Vector Machine  

Additionally, we have used these approaches in assignments where the implementation was provided by some code written in Python.

## Project Objective

In this project, your primary task is to apply 2 of these approaches to a larger scale data classification task.  
In doing so, you will choose a single data set which you will classify with each approach.  
The data set must have greater than a thousand labeled examples.  
These examples must be classified into one of two classes.  
Note that it is possible to find a large data set which has more than two classes from which you could always select examples from only two of the classes. If a dataset contains mixed data (numeric and other types) you can always simply ignore the non-numeric data.  
Once the data set has been classified, your job is to compare the results from the classifiers that you chose. The comparison (in general â€“ details will follow below) must include the following analyses:  

* Computational Times for both training and testing
* A confusion matrix
